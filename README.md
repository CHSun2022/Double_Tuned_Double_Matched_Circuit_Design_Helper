# Double_Tuned_Double_Matched_Circuit_Design_Helper
An open-source design tool for developing double-tuned and double-tuned double-matched RF coils for MRI .

The Double-Tuned Circuit Design Helper is intended for tuning a coil or balun at two resonance frequencies.
The Double-Tuned Double-Matched Circuit Design Helper extends this functionality to match the coil to 50 Î© at both Larmor frequencies.
